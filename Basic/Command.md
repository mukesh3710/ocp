## OpenShift Core Components

### Control Plane Components

#### API Server
```yaml
- The API server is the central management component that exposes the Kubernetes API.

oc get apiserver
oc get pods -n openshift-kube-apiserver
oc get pod -n openshift-kube-apiserver | grep kube-apiserver
```

#### Controller Manager
```yaml
- Manages controllers responsible for reconciling resources and ensuring the desired cluster state.

oc get clusteroperator kube-controller-manager
oc get pods -n openshift-kube-controller-manager
```

#### Scheduler
```yaml
- Assigns workloads to appropriate worker nodes based on resource availability.

oc get clusteroperator kube-scheduler
oc get pods -n openshift-kube-scheduler
```

#### etcd
```yaml
- The distributed key-value store used for cluster state persistence.

oc get etcd -n openshift-etcd
oc get pods -n openshift-etcd
oc exec -n openshift-etcd etcd-member-ip-<node> -- etcdctl endpoint status --write-out=table
```

#### Cluster Version Operator (CVO)
```yaml
- Handles cluster upgrades and ensures the OpenShift version consistency.

oc get clusterversion
oc get pods -n openshift-cluster-version
```
---

### Infrastructure & Node Management

#### Machine Config Operator (MCO)
```yaml
- Manages node configurations and OS-level updates.

oc get machineconfigpool
oc get clusteroperator machine-config
oc get pods -n openshift-machine-config-operator
```

#### Cluster Autoscaler
```yaml
- Automatically scales nodes.

oc get clusterautoscaler
```
#### Node Tuning Operator
```yaml
- Tunes kernel parameters for performance.

oc get tuneds -n openshift-cluster-node-tuning-operator
````
---

### Networking & Ingress

#### Ingress Operator
```yaml
- Handles routing for applications using OpenShiftâ€™s built-in HAProxy router.

oc get ingresscontroller -n openshift-ingress-operator
oc get clusteroperator ingress
```

#### Cluster Network Operator (CNO)
```yaml
- Manages networking (OVN-Kubernetes, OpenShift SDN).
oc get network.operator.openshift.io
```

#### Multus
```yaml
- Enables multiple network interfaces per pod.

oc get pods -n openshift-multus
```
---

### Security & Certificates

#### Authentication & OAuth
```yaml
- Manages user authentication via OAuth.

oc get oauth
oc get clusteroperator authentication
```

#### Certificate Management
```yaml
- Ensures secure communication within the cluster.

oc get certificates -n openshift-ingress-operator
oc get csr
oc describe csr <csr-name>
```

#### Compliance Operator
```yaml
- Enforces security compliance policies.

oc get compliancesuite -n openshift-compliance
```
---

### Storage & Persistent Data

#### OpenShift Data Foundation (ODF)
```yaml
- Provides software-defined storage (Ceph, Rook).

oc get storagecluster -n openshift-storage
oc get pods -n openshift-storage
```

#### Persistent Volumes (PV) & Persistent Volume Claims (PVC)
```yaml
- Handles storage requests for workloads.

oc get pv
oc get pvc -n <namespace>
```

#### Storage Classes
```yaml
- Defines storage policies and provisioning methods.

oc get sc
```
---

### Monitoring & Logging

#### Cluster Monitoring
```yaml
- Uses Prometheus, Grafana, and Alertmanager for monitoring and alerts.

oc get clusteroperator monitoring
oc get pods -n openshift-monitoring
```

#### Cluster Logging
```yaml
- Uses Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana.

oc get clusterlogging -n openshift-logging
```
---

### Application Management

#### Image Registry
```yaml
- Internal container image registry for OpenShift.

oc get clusteroperator image-registry
oc get pods -n openshift-image-registry
```

#### OpenShift Pipelines (Tekton)
```yaml
- Manages CI/CD workflows

oc get pods -n openshift-pipelines
```

#### OpenShift GitOps (ArgoCD)
```yaml
- Automates deployments via GitOps.

oc get pods -n openshift-gitops
```

#### OpenShift Serverless (Knative)
```yaml
- Supports serverless applications.

oc get knative-serving -n knative-serving
```

#### OpenShift Service Mesh (Istio)
```yaml

oc get servicemeshcontrolplane -n istio-system
```
---

### Operator Lifecycle Management

#### OperatorHub & OLM
```yaml
- Manages the lifecycle of OpenShift Operators.

oc get catalogsource -n openshift-marketplace
oc get subscriptions -n <namespace>
oc get csv -n <namespace>
```
---

### Additional Enterprise Components

```

#### OpenShift Quotas and Limits
```yaml
-  Defines resource quotas for namespaces.

oc get resourcequotas -n <namespace>
```

#### OpenShift Cluster API
```yaml
- Manages infrastructure lifecycle and self-healing.

oc get cluster
```
