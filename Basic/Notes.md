OpenShift Core Components:

API Server:
- The API server is the central management component that exposes the Kubernetes API.
oc get apiserver
oc get pods -n openshift-kube-apiserver
oc get pod -n openshift-kube-apiserver | grep kube-apiserver

Controller Manager:
- Manages controllers responsible for reconciling resources and ensuring the desired cluster state.
oc get clusteroperator kube-controller-manager
oc get pods -n openshift-kube-controller-manager

Scheduler:
- Assigns workloads to appropriate worker nodes based on resource availability.
oc get clusteroperator kube-scheduler
oc get pods -n openshift-kube-scheduler

etcd:
- The distributed key-value store used for cluster state persistence.
oc get etcd -n openshift-etcd
oc get pods -n openshift-etcd
oc exec -n openshift-etcd etcd-member-ip-<node> -- etcdctl endpoint status --write-out=table

Cluster Version Operator (CVO):
- Handles cluster upgrades and ensures the OpenShift version consistency.
oc get clusterversion
oc get pods -n openshift-cluster-version
```

### OpenShift API Server
```yaml
oc get clusteroperators kube-apiserver # Check Cluster API Health
oc get --raw /readyz # Check API Availability
oc get pods -n openshift-kube-apiserver # Check Pod Status
oc describe pod -n openshift-kube-apiserver <api-server-pod> # Describe the API Server Deployment
oc get pods -A | grep kube-apiserver # Check Running Pods

Verify etcd Health:
oc get pods -n openshift-etcd
oc logs -n openshift-etcd -l app=etcd
oc exec -n openshift-etcd etcd-member-ip-<node> -- etcdctl endpoint status --write-out=table

Validate Certificates & Authentication:
oc get secret -n openshift-kube-apiserver | grep tls
oc whoami
oc whoami --show-token
curl -k https://<api-server>:6443/version

Check API Server Endpoints:
oc whoami --show-server
curl -k -H "Authorization: Bearer $(oc whoami -t)" https://<api-server>/apis

Check API Server Metrics: Helps identify slow API requests.
oc get --raw /metrics | grep apiserver_request_duration_seconds

Validate API Server Resource Quotas & Limits:
oc get resourcequotas -n openshift-kube-apiserver

api-resources:
oc api-resources # List the available resource types 
oc api-resources --namespaced # to limit the output of the api-resources command to namespaced resources.
oc api-resources --namespaced -o name
oc api-resources --namespaced=false # Limit the output of the api-resources command to non-namespaced resources.
oc api-resources --api-group '' # to show only resources from the core API group
oc explain pods # to list a description and the available fields for the pods resource type
oc get pods # List all pods 
oc describe pod myapp-54fcdcd9d7-2h5vx #  to view the configuration and events for the pod
oc get pod myapp-54fcdcd9d7-2h5vx -o yaml # Retrieve the details of the pod in a structured format.
